# OpenScanner Test Infrastructure & E2E Test Plan (TEST_INFRA.md)

## 1. Test Philosophy & Principles

OpenScanner testing adheres to an **opaque-box, requirement-driven methodology**:
- **Requirement-Driven**: Tests are derived strictly from user requirements (`ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md`) and system specifications (`PROJECT.md`). Tests verify expected inputs and outputs against documented behavioral contracts rather than internal implementation quirks.
- **Opaque-Box Verification**: The test suite exercises public contracts, APIs, ViewModels, Room DAOs, CV algorithms, and data structures.
- **100% Offline Sandbox Isolation**: No network connectivity, external servers, cloud endpoints, or analytics services may be contacted. Tests execute deterministically in airplane/isolated mode.
- **Clean-Room & IP Integrity**: Zero proprietary assets, copyrighted resources, or third-party trademarked names in test fixtures, mocks, or assertions.
- **Tiered Multi-Level Architecture**: Tests are categorized into Tiers 1 through 5, ensuring progressive coverage from fundamental primitives to complex multi-step user workflows and adversarial edge cases.

### 2.2 Test Runner Invocation
All unit and integration tests are executed via Gradle on the local JVM:
```bash
JAVA_HOME=/home/krishna/.local/jdk-17 ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```
For individual test suites:
```bash
JAVA_HOME=/home/krishna/.local/jdk-17 ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "org.openscanner.cv.CollageGeneratorTest"
JAVA_HOME=/home/krishna/.local/jdk-17 ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "org.openscanner.e2e.E2EWorkflowsTest"
```

## 5. Verification Gate & Pass Criteria

The E2E Test Suite is considered **READY** when:
1. `JAVA_HOME=/home/krishna/.local/jdk-17 ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` completes with **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**.
2. Total test count covers all 32 features across Tiers 1–4 with **0 failures** and **0 skipped required tests**.
3. Zero network calls or external dependencies are invoked during execution.
4. `TEST_READY.md` is generated and published at the project root documenting verification results.
