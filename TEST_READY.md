## 3. Feature Coverage Mapping Across Tiers

All 32 features from `PROJECT.md` are mapped and verified:
1. **Tier 1 (Primitives & Happy Paths)**:
   - Features 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
   - Verified via unit test suites covering Room DAOs, model entities, CollageLayout slot math, PDF encryption options, and Camera modes.
2. **Tier 2 (Boundary & Corner Cases)**:
   - Features 1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 16, 17, 21, 24, 25.
   - Verified via boundary tests covering empty/single-page collections, non-existent files, 360° modulo rotations, whitespace-only strings, and slot aspect ratio fit-centering.
3. **Tier 3 (Cross-Feature Integrations)**:
   - Features 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 18, 19, 22, 27, 28.
   - Multi-component workflows verified in `E2EWorkflowsTest`:
     - Batch Capture -> Page Manager Reorder -> Watermarked & Encrypted PDF Export.
     - ID Card Front & Back Capture -> A4 Vertical Composite -> Signature Overlay Stamping.
     - Folder Creation -> Multi-Select Batch Move -> Folder Deletion with Document Unlinking.
4. **Tier 4 (Real-World Application Scenarios)**:
   - Features 7, 16, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32.
   - Comprehensive end-to-end user journeys verified in `E2EWorkflowsTest`:
     - Complete Office Document Scanning Journey (Capture -> Crop Quad -> Magic Color -> Offline OCR -> PDF).
     - Dual-Page Book Digitization Journey (Spread capture -> Center spine split -> Consecutive pages).
     - Expense Receipt Multi-Page Collage Compilation Journey (4 receipts -> 2x2 grid -> Single A4 sheet).

## 4. Architectural & Legal Compliance

1. **Strict Offline Guarantee**:
   - `AndroidManifest.xml` contains zero network permissions.
   - All tests run completely offline on the local JVM with zero socket/HTTP requests.
2. **Zero Proprietary Assets & Zero Competitor Branding**:
   - Clean-room test code exclusively references OpenScanner package structures (`org.openscanner.*`).
   - No third-party trademarked names, logos, or proprietary vector drawables are utilized.
